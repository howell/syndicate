#lang prospect-monolithic
;; Test case for a historical bug in Syndicate.
;;
;; When the bug existed, this program receiveed four SCN events in
;; total, whereas it should receive only two.
;;
;; While metamessages were "echo cancelled", and receivers only ever
;; got one copy of a sent metamessage no matter how many metas there
;; were, state changes were not. Issuing a quick enough "pulse" of
;; metaassertion while maintaining interest in it led to an "echo":
;; multiple receipts of the pulse.
;;
;; The fix was to adjust the implementation of state change
;; notifications to cancel the echo for metaassertions.
